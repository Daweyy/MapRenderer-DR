## About

Generate Dofus Retro maps as PNG, from [API.DofusRetro.fr](https://api.dofusretro.fr) datas

No images are provided with this project, only using the API to process (might take a while to process)

You may use your own local images, but you won't get any support with the extraction process

## How to use

- Clone the repository

- Install dependencies : 
```shell
npm install
```
- Process :
```shell
node main.js mapid
```

## Unsupported features
- Random sprites
- Ground levels
- Rotations (partially)
